# Module 0: Getting the tools

##  Tools to be installed
In this module you will work with 3 essential virtualization tools
[Vagrant](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.2/vagrant_2.0.2_x86_64.msi)
[Virtualbox](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.4/VirtualBox-5.2.4-119785-Win.exe)
[GitBash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Once the tools have been installed, you may be requested to restart the computer, Virtualization (AMD-v or VT-x) should be enabled and can be done from the BIOS but is beyond the scope of this workshop.
